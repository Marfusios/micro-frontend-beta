<p>
  This micro frontend uses external library <strong>Clarity Design</strong>.
  <a href="https://clarity.design" target="_blank">Project Clarity</a>
</p>
<p>
  External libraries are bundled together, see package json and `bundledDependencies`.
  Gateway doesn't need to know anything about these libraries.
